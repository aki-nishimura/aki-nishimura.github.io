Thank you for visiting my website!

I am a post-doctoral researcher at UCLA working with [Prof. Marc Suchard](http://faculty.biomath.ucla.edu/msuchard/) on analysis of large scale biomedical and healthcare data. I completed my PhD in Applied Mathematics and Statistics at Duke University under the supervision of [Prof. David Dunson](https://stat.duke.edu/people/david-b-dunson).

I have broad interests in use of mathematical and statistical models to solve and / or provide better understanding of scientific, social, and industrial problems. My expertise includes large-scale statistical computation, Bayesian analysis, Monte Carlo methods, numerical mathematics, as well as open-source software development.

In my free time, I enjoy traveling, social dancing (especially Argentinian tango), culinary explorations, photography, playing tennis, running / hiking, among many other things.
