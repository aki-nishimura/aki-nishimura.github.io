Thank you for visiting my website!

I am an Assistant Professor at [Johns Hopkins Biostatistics](https://www.jhsph.edu/departments/biostatistics/). I also serve as a Program-Chair of the [j-ISBA](https://j-isba.github.io/) section of International Society of Bayesian Analysis. I completed my PhD inÂ Applied Mathematics and Statistics at Duke University, during which I received [Laplace Award](https://math.duke.edu/news/graduate-student-akihiko-nishimura-wins-laplace-award) and [Savage Award](https://bayesian.org/project/savage-award/) (2nd place) for my research.

I develop statistical methods and software to extract useful insights from complex large-scale data sets, arising from various real-world applications. Current applications include hierarchical analysis of an international network of healthcare databases (in collaboration with [Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics](https://www.ohdsi.org/)), identifying patient characteristics predictive of their disease progressions (in collaboration with [Precision Medicine Initiative at Johns Hopkins](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/inhealth/)), discovery of mutations linked to virulence among HIV viruses (in collaboration with [BEAST](https://beast.community/) Team), among others. My expertise includes Bayesian methods, Monte Carlo simulation, high-performance computing, computational mathematics, as well as open-source software development.

In my free time, I enjoy traveling, social dancing (especially Argentinian tango), culinary explorations, photography, playing tennis, running / hiking, among many other things.
