Thank you for visiting my website!

I am a post-doctoral researcher at UCLA working with [Prof. Marc Suchard](http://faculty.biomath.ucla.edu/msuchard/) on large-scale analytics of observational healthcare data. I completed my PhD in Applied Mathematics and Statistics at Duke University under the supervision of [Prof. David Dunson](https://stat.duke.edu/people/david-b-dunson), during which I received [Laplace Award](https://math.duke.edu/news/graduate-student-akihiko-nishimura-wins-laplace-award) and [Savage Award](https://bayesian.org/project/savage-award/) (2nd place) for my research.

I develop statistical methods and softwares to extract useful insights from complex large-scale data sets, coming from various real-world applications. Current applications include subgroup identification (or 'precision medicine') in the first-line treatments of hypertensions, discovery of mutations linked to virulence among HIV viruses, etc. My expertise includes Bayesian methods, Monte Carlo simulation, high-performance computing, numerical mathematics, as well as open-source software development.

In my free time, I enjoy traveling, social dancing (especially Argentinian tango), culinary explorations, photography, playing tennis, running / hiking, among many other things.
